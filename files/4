User:
With over 63 moons, you might say I have a lot.
Look with a telescope to see my big, red spot.
The spot is a wind storm, swirling around.
High in the night sky is where I can be found.

Pass:

#include <stdio.h>
main() {
  long long P = 1,
            E = 2,
            T = 5,
            A = 61,
            L = 251,
            N = 3659,
            R = 271173410,
            G = 1479296389,
            x[] = { G * R * E * E * N , P * L * A * N * E * T };
  puts((char*)x);
}

gcc -o pass pass.c
./pass | xxd | base64 | sha1sum | cut -d ' ' -f1
