Hello hello!

Whattsappe? What's this? Where am i? How do i play? 


Simply `cat` the files to discover usernames and passwords for the next level ;)

To see the next level you have to exit the current session and login again with the new user and password.

There's also a couple of fun commands around, hack a little bit :) 


This thingy does not have full shell support yet, thus no backspace/arrows/special_characters allowed.
It's a very dumb terminal, if you have any clue how to implement the above features in Python/Paramiko ping me please, I'm still investigating the feasibility.
